## Esaki's “five don’ts” rules

In 1994 [Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindau_Nobel_Laureate_Meetings), Esaki suggests a list of “five don’ts” which anyone in realizing his creative potential should follow. Two months later, the chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics [Carl Nordling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Nordling) incorporated the rules in his own speech.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Esaki#cite_note-9)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Esaki#cite_note-Bio-2)

1. Don’t allow yourself to be trapped by your past experiences.
2. Don’t allow yourself to become overly attached to any one authority in your field – the great professor, perhaps.
3. Don’t hold on to what you don’t need.
4. Don’t avoid confrontation.
5. Don’t forget your spirit of childhood curiosity.

Now, as a disclaimer, I should remind you of the rule that anyone writing a blog post advising against *X* is himself the worst *X*er there is. At work, I have a history of painful languished projects, and I usually have the most overdue assignments of anyone on the team. As for writing, well, I have been working on this little blog post, on and off, no joke, for six years.

10 types of PEOPLE to DISTANCE yourself from:

Those who:

1.	Lie to you

2.	Use you

3.	Do not give you the benefit of the doubt

4.	Focus on your weaknesses, not strengths

5.	Take credit for your work

6.	Never thankful to you

7.	Blame you for their problems

8.	Speak bad of you behind your back

9.	Disrespect you

10.	Put you down

Life is too short – surround yourself with people who lift you higher.

How to handle criticism:

For example, Fralic is always impressed by founders who — when turned down — send some variation of, “Thanks for looking even if it’s not a fit. If you have other ideas for us or if anything changes, please let me know,” or, “Chris, when we met, you had a question/issue about X. I just wanted to show you what we’ve done about it — no need to respond.” “A person who says that shows she’s savvy enough to not take bad news personally, or create obligation or awkwardness, or continue to argue their point after you’ve said no. I’ll remember her for it,” he says.

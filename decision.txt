**Identify the decision-making process that will be used in the meeting**

Choose a decision-making method ahead of time to ensure that you leave your meeting with a clear outcome.

- **Majority vote** allows every voice to be heard and is generally viewed as fair—but be aware that it may be difficult for some to declare their opinion publically.
- **Group consensus** allows participants to share their expertise and enhances the chance for buy-in from all parties.
- **Leader’s choice** is usually the fastest approach, so is most appropriate in a crisis. The risk is that some ideas will go unheard. As a result, you may need to work harder to get skeptics on board, especially during implementation.

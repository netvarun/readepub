## Esaki's “five don’ts” rules

In 1994 [Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindau_Nobel_Laureate_Meetings), Esaki suggests a list of “five don’ts” which anyone in realizing his creative potential should follow. Two months later, the chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics [Carl Nordling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Nordling) incorporated the rules in his own speech.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Esaki#cite_note-9)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Esaki#cite_note-Bio-2)

1. Don’t allow yourself to be trapped by your past experiences.
2. Don’t allow yourself to become overly attached to any one authority in your field – the great professor, perhaps.
3. Don’t hold on to what you don’t need.
4. Don’t avoid confrontation.
5. Don’t forget your spirit of childhood curiosity.

Now, as a disclaimer, I should remind you of the rule that anyone writing a blog post advising against *X* is himself the worst *X*er there is. At work, I have a history of painful languished projects, and I usually have the most overdue assignments of anyone on the team. As for writing, well, I have been working on this little blog post, on and off, no joke, for six years.

10 types of PEOPLE to DISTANCE yourself from:

Those who:

1.    Lie to you

2.    Use you

3.    Do not give you the benefit of the doubt

4.    Focus on your weaknesses, not strengths

5.    Take credit for your work

6.    Never thankful to you

7.    Blame you for their problems

8.    Speak bad of you behind your back

9.    Disrespect you

10.    Put you down

Life is too short – surround yourself with people who lift you higher.

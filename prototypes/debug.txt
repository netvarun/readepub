The size is a factor as well, there is no way to look at it on a computer screen that is close to how you look at it in person ( <a href="https://www.moma.org/wp/inside_out/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JP_blog2.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://www.moma.org/wp/inside_out/wp-content/uploads/2012/0...</a> ). But we definitely have different tastes.<p>Regarding those soviet paintings, Goya depicted war and suffering, and is very well known and highly regarded: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_of_May_1808" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_of_May_1808</a> . But your point is the core of what the article is trying to get at. The people who evaluate art are looking for something that isn't being satisfied by the same criteria as i.e. journalism, cuisine, even music to a certain extent.

It's a trite emotion, which is the best way to describe the reaction I get to Pollock - trite.</p><p>I think that particular Pollock piece would make for a great panel or wallpaper in a basement. There's a certain movement and a not-unpleasant interplay with the colors - again, similar to the "boop, boop" on various public transportation system sound effects.</p><p>You can call it "art" sure, I think "craft" would be better, or perhaps "decorative arts" is probably the best way to describe Pollock. I recall a youtube video of the painting of a countertop in a kind of "hip, modern" kitchen that had a similar aesthetic.</p><p>Of course those Soviet paintings of WWI are far more meaningful than Pollack's visually not-unpleasant background color mix.

The warm colors evoke a feeling of sunlight, yet feel horrific. The muted faces are reminiscent of Edvard Munch's Scream. little explosions, or are they grasses, pop off everywhere. Chaos</p><p><a href="http://www.allworldwars.com/image/008/SovietPictures055.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.allworldwars.com/image/008/SovietPictures055.jpg</a></p><p>Good historical view of the hardships that women underwent in the absence of men. The little boy's face is almost plastic and is the only one seen in the painting. A lot of subtle commentary on the soviet system in here, as it ended up just like the old ways of the Czars</p><p><a href="http://www.allworldwars.com/image/008/SovietPictures069.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.allworldwars.com/image/008/SovietPictures069.jpg</a></p><p>Just like a Degas, at least to me. Not seeing the face of the player leaves you guessing as to how this solider got to be where he is. Was he a pianist before the draft? How did he learn to play? The gun is on his back and prominently central to the painting. The scattered papers tell a story of a battle and fleeing in panic. The highlighter colors give a waviness to it all, a sense of uncertainty and serenity pervades the piece</p><p><a href="http://www.allworldwars.com/image/008/SovietPictures057.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.allworldwars.com/image/008/SovietPictures057.jpg</a></p><p>Great use of sky, water and man. A private returns home, but to what? The war is over for him, but the peace is just as uncertain.

Just like the immigrant-farmer mother picture of the US depression. The woman shines in the dark room, her child tries to support her, her back is straight all the same despite the news. She faces off-stage and is nearly pushed off the bench by her child, who is in the center. The little window, her former existence, is full of things and life, she faces her new darker life with what appears to be a shroud and a rifle leaned up against the wall. The letter still hangs brightly in her right hand.

Those Soviet pieces are meant to be poignant, they're meant to be instantly emotionally evocative, and they're immensely successful in creating great content. The artist there is valuing impact, and truthful representation of a thing, be it the horror of war or the heartbroken silence of world shattered by a letter. However, these works are derivative. They are not novel in how they show their content; they use the same techniques that were popularized and perfected years ago. This is fine, because these paintings are complete in and of themselves.<p>Pollock on the other hand wasn't focused so much on the content of what he was creating, but on the process. Pollock wasn't trying to make you feel a thing, Pollock was trying to make a statement about what it means to be art. Pollock and other modern artists aren't looking to provide a story in isolation - they're iterating and expanding on a corpus of techniques, and means of representation, and questions about what it means to be art. Do I need to draw a person to show human suffering? Do I need to represent reality to make something meaningful? Can I create something that is recognizable as art while working under these arbitrary limitations?</p><p>I think this is true of any art/skill/techne - once the art reaches a certain level of maturity and sophistication. For practitioners, the new frontiers are not in the content you create (because it's established that you can create anything) but the process by which you make it. Look at modern poetry, and literature. A lot of the time these are very tangled, frustrating pieces to read because they break with the forms we are used to and iterate on them. Many of these aren't written to tell a story, or to make you feel, but to explore how one tells a story, or how one paints a thought in words. You see this to an extent in programming - there's very little value to writing conway's tree of life in brainfuck or competing to see who can write the smallest program that can reproduce the mona lisa in ASCII, but we do it because these limitations are challenging and cool to us.</p><p>(I'd argue that a Rothko painting can show just as much poignancy as any of those Soviet paintings you showed above.)

And that is to tell a story.<p>The best paintings provide a connection with a subject - person, place or time - and maybe stir up some emotion about the scene. Some of my favorite are 16th and 17th century Dutch paintings of naval battles. The artists were the war correspondents of their time and their work is as moving as any photograph from a modern battlefront.</p><p>Pollock's paintings tell a story in their own way too. I worked in theater in high-school and college and also painting boats and for an industrial coatings company. In short, I spent a lot of time around paint. A Pollock painting reminds me of these workshops: of years, sometimes decades of overspray, splatter, drips, spills and all of the other marks of "work being done here".</p><p>The scarred and stained surface of the workbench from my grandfather's garage could hang in a museum. Sixty years of paint and oil; holes from when tools were bolted to it or when parts were drilled; cuts from countless handsaws; scorch marks from blowtorches and soldering irons.</p><p>The painting is like the artistic expression of the evidence of work accomplished.

They are also clearly technically adept.<p>Jackson Pollock's paintings are interesting because he was the first to apply his technique in a studied way. They don't translate well to the digital era, but there is a certain arresting physicality to them when you see one in real life. Many of them are huge, and are not displayed within a frame. You can get very close and see the layers of paint rising up and the aging exposed canvas beneath.</p><p>Pollock is more famous than these painters because his work is distinctive. These soviet painters are good at painting, and you obviously connect to their subject matter, but comparing their work from [1], its hard to distinguish any of them as individual artists as their styles are only subtly different, much like Pollock's early work was fairly derivative of the original abstract expressionists and much like someone today deliberately aping a Pollock would not be celebrated in the same way (if not derided as a hack).</p><p>That said, I don't think figurative art is objectively better or worse than abstract art.

Once we acknowledge that artists are selling an experience, a pleasure, to art buyers then the 2m urinal makes perfect sense.<p>People are buying a pleasurable experience and each has a different taste.  Some people want a light show and so go to a big rock concert.  Some people want a pretty painting to look at while eating breakfast.  So they buy a painting.  Some people like the feeling of being better than other people.  So they buy objects that, for them and their peers, are a badge.  They demonstrate how much better their owners are than persons without such objects.  Many people like this feeling and are willing to pay.</p><p>Some of these people buy flashy cars to show themselves off as they drive to work.  Others buy paintings by the great masters and squirrel them away in a vault only to bring them out for dinner parties.  In that context, a 2m$ urinal isn't all that different.  It is an object that bestows barging rights on its owner.  Compared to a great many cars and paintings, both of which come with substantial maintenance costs, 2m$ for a bit of porcelain is cheep.

You can start with something as approachable, if disorganized as "Jelly Roll Blues"[0], and polish the genre into "Take the A Train" [1] as it became more generally popular.  After that, though, the bleeding edge of the genre self-protects itself away from the common ear by growing increasingly obscure, with bop [2], modal jazz [3], free jazz [4??] becoming progressively less approachable to the uninitiated ear, to the point that the the unfamiliar ear can hear the latter and find itself unable to recognize even as "music", while someone familiar with the genre can see the path and appreciate the work in context.</p><p>[0] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt203us6TME" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt203us6TME</a></p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb2w2m1JmCY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb2w2m1JmCY</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2tvlp7RnlM" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2tvlp7RnlM</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwmRQ0PBtXU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwmRQ0PBtXU</a></p><p>[4] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3CMgiUPuU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3CMgiUPuU</a>

There is a degree of technical skill that goes into a work of art (e.g. sculpting realistic bodies in marble or being able to draw consistent shapes or human anatomy, etc), but theorists would say that the truth of the art is about what emotions and ideas it expresses in the viewer.  In this way, since contemporary art often eschews craft, it can (in one sense of the term), be considered the most pure kind of art.</p><p>&gt; How can you judge a category of art for which there are no rules?</p><p>Keeping the above in mind, art isn't about rules or judgement, but about the personal message it sends to the viewer.  Because, after all, what are the "rules" you are ascribing to The David?  Realism? If so, then what would you say about impressionist works by, say, Claude Monet?</p><p>I say this also as a humble engineer (even if I come off as standoffish, which I hope I'm not), who happened to take a few art theory courses at school, which by no means makes me an expert: so this is just my own experience and perspective.</p><p>The most powerful experience I've had with a work of art was with one of Mark Rothko's paintings.  Sure, you can look at it as a plain wall of one or two colors in a plain square shape, but when I really got a good look at it for a prolonged period of time, I began to get lost in the colors and appreciated the nuances of the brushstrokes (it also helped that I had read John Logan's play "Red," which is a psychological profile about Rothko's method, which I recommend highly)</p><p>All of this to say that, yes, anyone with no skill can do random things with random items and call it art.  Because the skill, the things, and the items are not the true characteristics of what art is.  I don't think that "Fountain" should necessarily be marked as a masterpiece or objectively hailed as brilliant or anything, but I think to label it as "not art" misses the point (the point that it's trying to make a statement about art as a whole).  Art is not about skill/craft, but about communication between the artist and viewer.</p><p>That's my perspective on it at least!

Maybe some modern artists are taking the piss, like Duchamp, who was trolling the art society he was a part of with that[0].</p><p>Yes, you <i>could</i> assume Jackson Pollock was just throwing paint against a canvas and that can't be art because anyone could throw paint against a canvas, but like Marcel Duchamp and a lot of other modern artists, he was trying to say something[1], and <i>that's</i> what makes it art, not its reproducibility or realism.</p><p>Artists like Picasso and Mondrian were capable of creating traditional artwork in the classical style, but they became famous for their abstract work.

But regarding your specific example of "The David", let me ask you: which aspect of the sculpture is the art?<p>I would argue that replicating lifelike veins in marble is <i>not</i> the artistic part of David. That the <i>craft</i> - and surely many of Michaelangelo's contemporaries (and indeed many sculptors today) were also capable craftsmen when it came to sculpting. The <i>art</i> is the body language, expression, and overall "feel" of the piece.</p><p>This comes into sharp relief when you examine the work of someone like Robert Mapplethorpe[1] - who wanted to be a sculptor, but realized he could often achieve the same artistic goals with models and photography. He wanted to capture beauty and emotion through the human form - and the medium was just a means to an end.</p><p>All of this is to say that contemporary art is capable of communicating the same feelings as more classical artistic styles - and those feelings are really the point. The comparison between David and some college piece is also unfair. It has always been true 99% of everything is crap. What is the best contemporary art will only be apparent in retrospect. Stuff you see around a college campus is likely not even the best of contemporary art at the time it's created (that's why it's on a campus). Comparing that to art that has had 300+ years of societal filtering doesn't really make sense.</p><p>One of my favourite pieces of contemporary art is "Fuck Death" by Leon Golub[2]. I like its straightforward starkness and the way it seems hastily done - as if the painter was in a hurry because death is, indeed, coming. The technical aspects of this piece are, honestly, not very impressive. It's a very simple watercolour. But it speaks to me in a way that classical depictions of death, with all their craft and realism, really don't. That ability to communicate feeling is <i>the art</i>. The choice of medium or style is just aesthetic preference.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mapplethorpe" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mapplethorpe</a></p><p>[2] <a href="http://interrum.tumblr.com/post/59580566966/bidartanalysis-fuck-death-1999-leon-golub" rel="nofollow">http://interrum.tumblr.com/post/59580566966/bidartanalysis-f...</a></p><p>Edit: I am also a humble engineer, so I'm probably just re-inventing art theory 101 here. But I don't think contemporary art is as worthless as many seem to think.

I can't stop returning because italy is dripping with it every where you turn, constantly full of awe-inspiring surprises. In terms of workmanship, there is nothing since which compares to even the 10th-best basilica in rome.<p>But I don't appreciate those nearly as much as I do no-named postmodern pieces, even procedurally-generated ones. There are so many curious layers of questions that arise when staring into the abstract and being left to your own perception to pull out appreciable components. So much to wonder about the artist, his intentions, and his chaotic vision or process. It is far deeper than masterful material work.</p><p>Considering how absolutely we are able to control materials these days, particularly now that atomic-level artificial composition is within our power, I find the questions of what? why? why not? or even lol wtf? far more appetizing to modern curiosity.

He was deeply skeptical of all institutions of prestige and never attended college. His father was a professor, double math/physics PhD at Berkeley.

You may dispute the order, but thatâ€™s where Iâ€™ve seen the category _medians_ fall. The art example: buy a toilet and sell it for millions, is brazen chicanery; in fact thatâ€™s what gives it value, although you might also agree that the network made it possible. Similarly, many startups are technical garbage before they get money-bombed into a foregone conclusion. Network? Charisma? Luck? Outrageous claims that offend technical experts? Itâ€™s not that different from the art world.</p><p>But is it good advice to network? PG says no. AVC says no. Trust that there are plenty of failed artists trying to network their way into million dollar toilets too. On average, plumbers do better, but nobodyâ€™s impressed with a working toilet until they stop going to burning man and divorce the artist.

In particular, works that have expanded the boundaries of what is regarded as art have value as historical artifacts, and the artist who created them reached a higher level of performance, on that particular work (as originality is an important aspect of performance), than those producing works that follow the pattern (including that artist, when producing subsequent works in the same vein.)</p><p>This point of view would assign considerable value to Duchamp's original 'Fountain', but not much to a replica, which would compare unfavorably to other, original, examples of signed plumbing.

But I interpreted the article to mean that as it becomes more difficult to determine inherent worth in an area, success becomes more and more dependent on social networking effects per se. If you need a hammer, it has a specific function, and you can quantify that function in various ways. But if you're talking about something where the value is unknown, either because no one knows the ultimate truth, or because it's based on subjective experience or something, you can't quantify it, so you go back to networks.</p><p>This author has been making the rounds a bit in the last few years, and I think they've done research on these topics. Their argument is that network effects are very strong, and account for a lot of variability in outcomes that are popularly attributed to individuals (broadly defined).

He gave me a hilarious primer on how his business worked as we made our way to Paris. In short, art demand is to a very large extent driven only by what's on display at the art dealers' places during their exclusive parties. A good way to think about this is that art dealers are opinion leaders and create new art trends as they see fit Ã&nbsp; la Devil Wears Prada.

If the goal is making lots of money, and one is able to pump up the price of an artists works by 1000%, wouldn't one come out farther ahead by selling (at least a few) of the paintings to outsiders, rather than donating all of them?<p>While it seems possible that flooding the market with all 100 paintings at once might crash the price down more than the tax writeoff is worth, it seems unlikely that this would happen on the first sale.  The counterargument would have to be that there doesn't actually exist any outsider who would pay anything close to the claimed value for the work.</p><p>Another odd aspect of this is that once individuals own a substantial numbers of works by an artist, it's in their interest to keep the price high for that artist's works.  So if a new painting comes up for auction, they would benefit by never allowing it to be sold for a low price --- even if that means "overpaying" for the new painting.   So maybe the end game is that the minority owners start to sell, knowing that the majority owners have to buy, and only after all the works have single ownership (with a record of high sales prices) sales does the donation scheme happen.</p><p>Interesting.  I presume others have analyzed these strategies in depth?
